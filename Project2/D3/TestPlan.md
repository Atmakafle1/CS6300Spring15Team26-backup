# Test Plan

**Author**: **Team26**

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

#### 1.1.1 Unit Testing Strategy

Unit testing will first be performed to ensure the functionality of each modules individually. Each method of each 
classes will be tested to ensure it behaves exactly as expected. Unit test cases will be prepared by the QA manager based 
on the requirement specifications and executed by application developers during software construction phase. Thus any 
faulty module can be fixed immediately rather than let it exist and then cause some major issue in the integration phase.

#### 1.1.2 Integration Testing Strategy

Integration testing confirms that each piece of the application interacts as designed and that all functionality is
working. Integration testing includes interactions between all layers of an application, including interfaces to other
applications, as a complete end-to-end test of the functionality. Integration test cases will be prepared and executed
by QA manager and should cover all possible interactions or paths between each modules. Other team members will review
the test cases to make sure the functional coverage is complete.

#### 1.1.3 System Testing Strategy

The purpose of system testing is to make sure that the software system developed complies with the definition of the
software requirements. QA manager will be prepare test cases that will cover all scenarios for the requirements and these
will be reviewed by other team members.

#### 1.1.4 Regression Testing Strategy

Regression testing is to make sure that the software behaves well after code revision. Retesting for fixed bugs will be
done by QA manager and resolved by the developer. Not only test cases that focused on the changed software components 
should be retested, but other modules should also be checked to make sure that the defects are not propagated to other 
modules. 

### 1.2 Test Selection

#### 1.2.1 Unit Test

Black box testing techniques will be used to validate the behavior of each component. Valid input should get correct output and invalid input should display error messages and actions are not allowed. 
For example, for customer component, first name, last name, zipcode, and email should all have valid input to be save into database.

#### 1.2.2 Integration Test

Black box testing techniques will be used for integration testing. The tester verifies that units work 
together when they are integrated into a larger code base. Just because the components work individually, that doesnâ€™t mean
that they all work together when assembled or integrated. For example, data might get lost across an interface, messages 
might not get passed properly, or interfaces might not be implemented as specified. 
Test cases for integration tests are 
selected from a list of all possible interactions between different components. The interactions in this app includes stall manager - new customer , stall manager - customer info and stall manager - transaction. 

#### 1.2.3 System Test

Black box testing technique will be used for the system testing. Test cases are selected based on the test case specifications 
generated by the software's requirements. Each test case represent a different use case that satisfy one specific requirement. 
All scenarios or paths should be covered based on the component diagram. 

#### 1.2.4 Regression Test

Black box testing will be used for regression tests throughout all testing cycles to verify that modifications 
have not caused unintended effects and that the system or component still complies with its specified requirements. Regression 
tests are a subset of the original set of test cases. These test cases are re-run often, after any significant changes (bug 
fixes or enhancements) are made to the code. Since regression tests are run throughout the development cycle, there can be 
white box regression tests at the unit and integration levels and black box tests at the integration and system test levels.
The following guidelines are used when choosing a set of regression tests:
- Choose a representative sample of tests that exercise all the existing software functions;- Choose tests that focus on the software components/functions that have been changed;- Choose additional test cases that focus on the software functions that are most likely to be affected by the change.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

For unit testing, test cases are selected to ensure each component work properly. Boundary conditions and error exceptions will be included in the test cases.

For integration and system tests, QA will prepare test cases that will cover all scenarios for the requirements and map test 
cases to respective requirement to ensure the coverage for requirements. Peer review will be conducted by other team members.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Github Issues can be used to track ideas, enhancements, tasks or bugs. Feedbacks from all team members can be collected via a
central bug tracker.

- Deal with your issues just like you deal with email
- Create and apply labels to issues to assign to users or categorize
Drag and drop issues to prioritize them
- Vote on issues that you want to see tackled
- Search, sort, and filter
- Close issues from commit messages

### 1.5 Technology

- Eclipse IDE with an android simulator/android device is used to develop and test the application.
- Manual tests are conducted to ensure all functionalities.
