# Project Plan

**Author**: **Team26**

## 1 Introduction

We will be producing an Android mobile application for Payment and Rewards Management System (PReMS) for a Mobile stall
at local farmers markets in the Atlanta area. The application will allow two young famers (Brad and Janet) to manage
payment and reward their royal customers. The application user interfaces are targeted for usage on an Android Phone; 
however even Android tablets can be used to run this application.

## 2 Process Description

The PReMS will be implemented using the UML based Process which will consist of 3 phases and multiple iterations 
throughout the application’s design and implementation phase. There will be a set of documents and activities that 
will be  produced as part of this process. The description of these documents and activities generated in each of the 
phases is given below.

###2.1 Inception and Elaboration (Week 1)

This phase includes the overall planning of activities for the whole project, documenting the whole process and defining 
individual and team responsibilities.

####2.1.1 Project Plan (current document) 
A project plan will be drafted by the project manager and reviewed & approved by the team. The project plan will be 
tracked on an ongoing basis until the completion of the project. Metrics will be captured as and when necessary.

####2.1.2 Vision Document 
The vision document will outline the business needs, requirements, production, solution, major features, scope,
accessibility and limitation of PReMS.

####2.1.3 Use Case Model
The use case model contains a use case diagram with descriptions to depict all the actors and use cases for the system.
The use cases will explain how various actors interact with the system and what the outcome is. This part may include
multiple scenarios for normal/alternate/exceptional event sequences.

####2.1.4 Supplementary Requirements
This document will outline the various non­-functional requirements; whereas the use-case model mainly captures the 
business requirements/scenarios.

####2.1.5 Design Document
This document will outline all design considerations, assumptions, constraints and system environment. It will also
depict the system operation through high-level and low-level designs. UML diagrams such as component diagrams, class
diagrams etc... will be used to depict the architecture and design.

####2.1.6 Test plan (without results)
This document will provide a concise description of how to test the system. The test techniques and test levels will be
defined. A table of test cases will be provided that the application must satisfy. Each test case will contain the 
description of how to run it, what inputs to provide, and its expected output. The result of the test cases will not be 
presented in iteration-1.

**Entrance Criteria**

- Request for creation of an Android application for a Mobile stall at local farmers markets
- Set of team members
- Instructor notes on specific deliverables required for the assignment (plan, requirements, design, code, documentation)
- Documented set of requirements for the Android Application
- Product release deadline

**Exit Criteria**

- Finalized project plan, vision document, use case model, supplementary requirements, design document and test plan
- Agreed iteration plan with deliverables specified for each week
- Agreed project roles for the individuals
- Agreed project execution methodology
- Agreed timelines for the execution of various phases
- All documents to be uploaded to Github repository

###2.2 Construction (Week 2)

####2.2.1 Revise Earlier Documents
The initial project plan, vision document, supplementary requirements, design document and test plan are revised as
needed during the execution of the various iterations. Along with that, the following activities are planned

####2.2.2 Traceability Information
The traceability information is captured in a tabular format to map the flow from use cases to the design elements, 
code and test cases. 

####2.2.3 Develop Initial Version App
The initial version of the application will be developed as per the agreed requirements and design.

####2.2.4 Complete Test Plan with Results
The application will be tested based on the test plan and the results will be documented. The test cases will have to 
adequately cover the functionality of the application. The QA manager will work with the development lead to fix 
defects and make sure all tests are passed. The code coverage details will also be validated if time permits. The 
test results will be added in Test Plan document.

####2.2.5 User manual
Detailed user guides will be documented and released with the software. It will contain both usage guide and
troubleshooting information for the software. The content will be written by the documentation lead and reviewed by 
all team members.

**Entrance Criteria**

- Project plan, vision document, use case model, supplementary requirements, design document, test plan(without result)
- Software requirements

**Exit Criteria**

- All updated documents reviewed by all team members
- Agreed design and source code for the application including test cases
- Initial version of User manual
- Updated test plan with results
- Updated Traceability matrix
- All artifacts to be uploaded to Github repository

###2.3 Transition (Week 3)

####2.3.1 Revise Earlier Documents
In this phase, the team will go over all the documents and make any final changes.

####2.3.2 Release Final Version App
The Beta version of the application will be reviewed and revised (if necessary) to meet all requirements. A final 
commit-id will be submitted to T­-Square by the project manager as part of assignment submission.

**Entrance Criteria**

- Project plan, vision document, use case model, supplementary requirements, design document, test plan and user manual
- Software requirements specification
- Application source code

**Exit Criteria**

- Update and agree on the final version of the application
- Agreed test cases (integration, system and unit tests) that test each requirement
- Update and approval of all documents by the team
- No critical/major/minor defects
- All artifacts to be uploaded to Github repository

## 3 Team

The project team constitutes of the following members:

- Yuchun Qin
- Cedric Meury
- Yue Li
- Ganesh Shivashankaraiah

The description of roles assigned to team members are given below:

- **Project Manager:** The project manager is responsible for setting goals and tracking the whole progress. This role
is responsible for drafting the project plan and use case model.
- **Development Lead:** The development lead writes the code for the Android application, and manages merges of
different branches in the Github repository. 
- **Documentation Lead:** The documentation lead manages the various documents and writes the supplementary document and
user manual.
- **QA Manager:** The QA manager will prepare test cases and write code to test/debug the code and evaluates the quality
of the application to meet all requirements. This role will draft the test plan.

In this project, the roles are assigned as follows:

| Team Member             | Role(s)                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |

| Ganesh Shivashankaraiah | Documentation Lead, Developer  |

- Each team member is expected to review documents and source code on Github as needed. 
- Weekly meetings (twice per week) are scheduled on Google Hangout for the entire team to understand the progress and
discuss any issues
- Project team will collaborate on `Slack.com` on a continuous basis
- `Github` will be used as the source control repository
- Defects will be captured during testing using Slack/Github and the individual team members will be assigned as owners

## 4 Estimates
